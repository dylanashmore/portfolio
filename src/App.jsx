      <p>
           Hi! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida interested in UI/UX design and full stack development.
            Before CS, I studied Graphic Design at Hillsborough Community College and earned my associate's degree.
            I have always had a keen eye and love for design of all types, so when I learned about the field of UI/UX design,
            I knew it would be perfect for me since it combines design with logical systems and analytical thinking.

              <p>We made this project to help our fellow UCF Knights to study for the Foundation Exam utlizing previous exam questions. The main focus
                was to improve the user experience and functionality from previous study sites made by other students.

              <h3>Ramos Fencing</h3>
              <p>       I developed this website for a local fencing company using React and React Router to build dynamic service 
                        pages and responsive image galleries. This was my first full project where I also designed the mobile 
                        experience, ensuring smooth navigation and layouts across devices. I gained hands-on experience with CSS, 
                        JavaScript, and user experience design principles, and I set up the backend to handle form submissions so 
                        the company could easily receive customer inquiries.
